## Self-Evaluating Role Agent
A chatbot application built directly with OpenAI's models(gpt-4o-mini and gpt-4.1-nano) and Gradio for UI that uses a resume and summary to answer questions about a person’s background, projects, and experience. Each response is evaluated by a second model for quality, and revised automatically if necessary.
